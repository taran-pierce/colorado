# Colorado `v3`
Just wanted a way to be able to show off some photos of places we have been here in Colorado since moving here. Very much a work in progress, testing out developing and deploying an Astro.build app.

## Setup
- cd into `app`
- `npm install`

## NPM tasks
- Run `npm run dev` to start dev server
- Run `npm run build` to build all the assets for production
